# Hello world, I'm Arlan Butar Butar👋

🔥 <i><strong>I am a Software Engineer</strong></i><br> 
More specifically as a Back End Web Developer. I also have my own startup called Netmedia Framecode which has started a business since 2018. I am currently a student at Widya Mandira Catholic University. I have participated in various off-campus activities, such as Re-Cloud from <a href="https://codepolitan.com/">Codepolitan</a> and <a href="https://id.alibabacloud.com/">Alibaba Cloud Indonesia</a>.

⚡ <i><strong>My Job</strong></i><br>
I started learning coding since I was in junior high school, when it happened that my uncle was studying at STIKOM and I was also learning how to create a website. Currently, I can create complex website-based applications such as administrative bookkeeping applications and others. In learning programming languages, I didn't go straight to the database management system stage, but started from how to design a website to make it attractive.

🌠 <i><strong>Another life</strong></i><br>
I not only have skills in the programming world but I also learned how to be a video editor and photo editor.
